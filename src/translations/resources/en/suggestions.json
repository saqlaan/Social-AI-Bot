  "moreSuggestion": "Sometimes creators aren’t comfortable posting a video unless it’s “perfect.”\nIn fact, your followers will respond better to videos that feel more natural - flaws and all.\nTry making a 30-second reel right now. Just turn on your camera and say something like:\n“Hi folks, just checking in. I’m thinking about some more ways to work with old sign letters. Nothing to show yet, but stay tuned!
